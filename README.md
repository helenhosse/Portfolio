# Portfolio

## USER Story

AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to create a portfolio that showcases my projects and contact information
SO THAT I can apply to web development positions

## Description

In this challenge, I have made a portfolio that will showcase the different projects that I have completed throughout my bootcamp experience. There is a section that is about me, a project section, a section that contains all of my contact information, and a link that will go to my resume once uploaded. 

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport

## Installation

I have provided 2 links at the end of this page that should be able to work on any device.
